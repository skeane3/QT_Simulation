# QT_Simulation

A Jupyter notebook to simulate the effect of quantum tunnelling of an electron in 1 dimension, using the Crank-Nicolson method for solving partial differntial
equations as part of the PYP11Q20 module of my MSc in Quantum science and Technology (https://www.tcd.ie/Physics/quantumtech/).
